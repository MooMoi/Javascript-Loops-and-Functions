# mintNFT

This JavaScript program allows users to mint NFTs, list the NFTs in the collection, and view the total supply of NFTs. The program is designed to manage a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with each token having a name, rarity, and owner.

## Description

The program consists of three main functions:

- **mintNFT**: Mints a new NFT by taking the name, rarity, and owner as inputs. If any of these fields are missing, an error message is displayed.
- **listNFTs**: Lists all the NFTs in the collection, displaying their name, rarity, and owner.
- **getTotalSupply**: Returns the total number of NFTs minted in the collection.

The program tracks the collection of NFTs in the `nftCollection` array and provides basic functionality to mint, list, and count NFTs.

## Getting Started

### Executing Program

To run this program, you can use any JavaScript environment, such as a browser console or Node.js.

1. Open a text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and create a new `.js` file (e.g., `NFTCollection.js`).
2. Copy and paste the code into the file.
3. Run the program in the browser console or through Node.js.

### Interacting with the Program

- **Mint NFTs**: Call the `mintNFT` function with the name, rarity, and owner of the NFT you want to create.
- **List NFTs**: Use the `listNFTs` function to display all minted NFTs in the collection.
- **Get Total Supply**: Call the `getTotalSupply` function to see how many NFTs have been minted in total.
